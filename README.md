###DESCRIPTION

This is an Angular Javascript app for a newspaper company owner to organize the beats in a newspaper called Beat Roots (not street roots), as well as the reporters assigned to each beat.

Your heart might skip a **beat!**

###SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

From your terminal, go to the newspaper directory and enter `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

Then go to localhost:8000 in your browser to view the app.

You'll see, this site can't be **beat!** Ah man, gotcha again.
